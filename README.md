This repository contains a demonstration of an uncommon error in PHP code that involves handling non-numeric values in an array. The function `calculateSum` is designed to calculate the sum of numbers in an array. However, it does not properly handle cases where the array contains non-numeric values.  The `bug.php` file shows the erroneous code and its output. The `bugSolution.php` file provides a corrected version that addresses the issue and handles non-numeric values gracefully.
